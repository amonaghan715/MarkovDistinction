Title: ParfumerieSetSimultator

Description: This system creates potential set layouts for Masque and Gown's upcoming fall show, Le Parfumerie. Each layout has a few key requirements, a balcony and staircase somewhere on set, three doors, at least one wall of shelves, and counters for the employees to do their work. Everything else, the colors of the set pieces, their placement, etc. is determined by the system.

Theater is something I am greatly passionate about, and I am always looking for ways to intersect it with programming and Computer Science. This system is personally meaningful to me because I am stage managing for this production, and we are currently trying to decide what we want our set to look like. I have never stage managed a production before; I have always been on the acting side of things, so I am looking forward to seeing a different side of production. However, I am always nervous that my lack of experience will negatively impact the production, and I am constantly searching for ways to do more. This system is one product of that search. I hope to be able to bring some of the set iterations created by my program to the production team to help us as we find our vision for the set. Though I doubt that any of these iterations will be our final product, they can certainly inspire new ideas of specifications along the way.
