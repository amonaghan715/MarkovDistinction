Title: ParfumerieSetSimultator

Description: This system creates potential set layouts for Masque and Gown's upcoming fall show, Le Parfumerie. Each layout has a few key requirements, a balcony and staircase somewhere on set, three doors, at least one wall of shelves, and counters for the employees to do their work. Everything else, the colors of the set pieces, their placement, etc. is determined by the system.
